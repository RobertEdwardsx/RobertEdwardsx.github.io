<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it supplies protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" freely transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software application to spot it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only a false sense of security given that it prevents only "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally regular since the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone going into the shop.
