<p>As the name recommends, this alarm is a starter set". So it's pretty much expected that it will not have actually extended customizability or a large range of functions. However, I am still disappointed that they haven't consisted of a minimum of a basic camera with this package. Cameras are pretty basic for self monitored alarm systems, specifically because incorrect alarms is an extremely real possibility.</p>
<p>If you choose that home automation is a fundamental part of your home security, it's a good concept to research home automation protocols to learn which one will work best for you.
