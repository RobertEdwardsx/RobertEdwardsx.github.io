<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely typical because the entrance and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when clients understand that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
