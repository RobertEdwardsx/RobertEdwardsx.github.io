<p>Nothing is more crucial than securing what you treasure most ... your household and home. The implicit reason for the current push to increase video surveillance is the danger of terrorist attacks. But suicide assaulters are plainly not hindered by video cameras - and may even be drawn in to the tv protection cameras can guarantee - and the cost of a substantial video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up approximately 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice spending plan - far exceeds the minimal advantages that the system might supply in examining attacks or attempted attacks after the reality (see truth sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
