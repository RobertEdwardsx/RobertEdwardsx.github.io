<p>A tight wire perimeter security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to spot any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensors to disregard objects that exert percentages of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is set up to prevent this kind of attack.</p>
