The Nest also includes clips to make the installation tidy and more difficult to swipe off the side of a house.</p>
<p>Now I pointed out this looked like a stretch considering previous Sims games had robbers, but my good friend explained the Sims 4 was produced a new generation, with a team of manufacturers surrounded by people OF that generation who would point out that the intrusion of their home or safe place might develop feelings of discomfort or possible even setting off. Indirectly I can see his point, I have actually been playing games for a very long time and a lot of the stuff in earlier games I have actually played a years back would definitely NEVER make the cut in todays politically charged gaming environment.</p>
