<p>Nevermind how fantastic the cameras are. The very first question you should be asking is which of these companies is selling your data to third party companies? I have actually dropped my Nest Cams since they were bought by Google. Something all of us require to consider. Sirens. So your camera has actually identified trespassers or wild animals. Do you wish to terrify them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will do the trick. Keep in mind that these sirens might break local sound control laws, so check ahead of time prior to making the purchase.</p>

Cameras that are not monitored by the main station can not be accessed our operators for any factor, even if asked for by the customer. </p>
