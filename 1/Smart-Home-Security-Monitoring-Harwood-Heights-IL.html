<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky.

Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion sets off.</p>
