<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely typical considering that the doorway and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when customers understand that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's generally far too late given that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
