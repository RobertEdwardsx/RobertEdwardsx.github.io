It can be sluggish and awkward to utilize on occasion - with the procedure of connecting to the camera for a live view rather sluggish at times. The previous, more affordable variation of the outdoor Nest web cam is still on sale too if you want to conserve some money - it does have a cable television connected however, instead of working wirelessly, which implies it's a bit easier to screw up for potential trespassers.
