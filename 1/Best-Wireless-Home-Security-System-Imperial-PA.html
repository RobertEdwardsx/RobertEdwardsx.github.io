<p>As far as the app goes, D-Link has actually plainly attempted to offer it an attractive edge, and we have to provide credit to its capability to show what's going on from up to four cameras at a time.

The previous, less expensive version of the outdoor Nest camera is still on sale too if you want to conserve some money - it does have a cable television attached however, instead of working wirelessly, which indicates it's a bit simpler to mess up for potential trespassers.
