The implicit justification for the current push to increase video surveillance is the hazard of terrorist attacks. But suicide enemies are clearly not prevented by video cameras - and may even be brought in to the television protection cameras can ensure - and the expense of a comprehensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up roughly 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice budget plan - far surpasses the limited advantages that the system might supply in investigating attacks or tried attacks after the fact (see reality sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
