<p>If you're trying to find motion detection, the Canary Flex includes a smart variation that sends alerts directly to your phone. This camera offers a wide range of functions consisting of a 360-degree rotating base. Last time I evaluated a Swann camera I described it as extremely middle of the roadway. Not excellent, not terrible, however with a truly simple setup procedure (and trust me, that really is a killer function when it concerns smart cameras.)

<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face informs, which can determine people the camera is identifying using face recognition. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to identify those people and will send mobile phone notifies with that information when they appear at your home. We believe this feature (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to want to differentiate predicted visitors from random strangers. We also found the feature to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to determine faces on a nearby TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) likewise offer a broader series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
