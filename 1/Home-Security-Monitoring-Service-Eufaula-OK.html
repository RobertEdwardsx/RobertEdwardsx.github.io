<p>On the surface, these 2 camera classifications may appear comparable, though if you were able to see inside, the differences become unique and obvious. Commercial-grade cameras are created and constructed for high-performance applications where failure is not an alternative; consumer-grade cameras are not. Generally, consumer-grade cameras are constructed to work well when there is a lot of readily available light, and when the lighting becomes missing or low (believe sunset or nighttime), their pedigree starts to show.

If you have large family pets, you may want to think about avoiding the motion sensors and rely more on the doors and window sensors which aren't activated by motion but are set off when a window or door is opened.</p>

Some systems save tape-recorded video locally on an SD card or a strong state drive, while others use cloud storage.
