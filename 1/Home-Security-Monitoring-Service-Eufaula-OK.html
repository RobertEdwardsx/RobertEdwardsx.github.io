Commercial-grade cameras are created and constructed for high-performance applications where failure is not an alternative; consumer-grade cameras are not. Generally, consumer-grade cameras are constructed to work well when there is a lot of readily available light, and when the lighting becomes missing or low (believe sunset or nighttime), their pedigree starts to show.
