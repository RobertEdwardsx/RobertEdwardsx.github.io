<p>Analog security cameras send lower resolution video over coax cable television and record to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) which can deal with such things as scheduling, motion detection, and digital zoom. The DVR converts the analog signal to digital, compresses it, and after that stores it on a hard disk drive for later retrieval. Screens can be connected to the DVR for viewing, or the system can be established to interact via network or mobile app for seeing.</p>
<p>Smart gadget integration: If you have a home full of smart gadgets, think about looking for a security camera or an all-in-one home monitor that consists of a Z-Wave, ZigBee, or-- ultimately a Thread-- radio that can connect them.

<p>Another location where Arlo stands out is customer support.
