<p>Are independently owned, operated surveillance cameras to be dealt with the very same method as public cameras? We also require to draw great lines about 'Who actually is viewing you'? 'Who owns that camera anyhow'? Huge sibling? The Corporates? Or bothering neighbour? Who fixes a limit between public interest and harassment? At the moment, no one!
