<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids speaking to someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, false alarms are fairly typical. If a homeowner forgets their keys and returns within with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is triggered by an area feline, it can set off the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the homeowner will be contacted by the monitoring company whenever the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it quickly. False alarms occur. With a self-monitored system, a house owner will not receive calls from a monitoring company. Rather, property owners access the alarm themselves and take the necessary action.</p>
