These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a brightened space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see in the evening. If recording video in the dark is a concern, ensure your camera has lots of IR LEDs.</p>
