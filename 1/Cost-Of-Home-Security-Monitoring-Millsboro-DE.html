<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely regular because the doorway and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level.
