<h2>Cloud Video Monitoring & Video Surveillance For Security Cameras Plainview</h2>

<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it offers protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" freely transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software to find it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just a false complacency since it prevents just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
