<p>One crucial exception: ADT has a landline monitoring plan that's $36.99 per month, which might be an economical alternative for customers in backwoods. We suggest cellular systems due to the fact that they're much more secure than landline systems, however there are some locations where cellular monitoring isn't readily available. If you live someplace without access to cellular monitoring, a landline system is still much better than no security at all.</p>
