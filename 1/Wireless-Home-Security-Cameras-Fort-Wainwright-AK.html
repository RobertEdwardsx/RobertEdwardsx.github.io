<p>SimpliSafe equipment covers the essentials. But while ADT systems deal with Z-Wave gadgets, SimpliSafe systems do not.

<p>Also called eyeball" cameras, the turret camera has a ball-and-socket joint to let you exactly reroute the field of vision without remounting the security camera each time. They're terrific for warehouses.
