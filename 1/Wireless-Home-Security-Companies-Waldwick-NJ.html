<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your house so we might point them at the very same area and expose them all to the same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting components, which I had installed on the deck by a licensed electrical expert (who happens to be my husband). All of the cameras were connected to the exact same 2.4 GHz network by means of a Wi-Fi router inside your home (approximately 40 feet from the cameras); service to your house was Verizon Fios.</p>

Additionally, if you think that there's been a burglary, you can utilize the panic button in the remote tag to immediately contact the authorities or local emergency service. </p>
