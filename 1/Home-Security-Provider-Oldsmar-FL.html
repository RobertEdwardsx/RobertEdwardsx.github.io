On the simpler side, with SimpliSafe, you trade the bells and whistles of smart home equipment for flexibility and low prices. SimpliSafe does have a video doorbell with two-way audio, however you can't add a ton of other smart home tech to the system. It won't work with loads of smart home equipment from other companies. The app is hugely remarkable, and while the level of control does not match SmartThings, producing 'Actions' - such as turning the hall light on when you open the front door, or showing up the heat when you trip the motion sensor in the early morning - are refreshingly easy.</p>

<p>Because it's more complex than it needs to be, we do not recommend the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, alerts, and combination all need different IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month fee (or $80 each year) to store 30-second clips for thirty days.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is a solid all-around camera that works inside or out, and it's very simple to install. The greatest disadvantage is the investment.
