(A four-camera pack expenses $504.72 at the time of composing.) However we can't fault Arlo too much for that-- any top quality multi-camera system is going to strike your wallet hard.</p>
<p>With an analog system, coaxial cable is required for transferring video footage from the CCTV security cameras. This is one of the disadvantages of analog CCTV video surveillance, as the cable television can be difficult and pricey to install, especially for bigger camera networks, and those were cameras should be positioned in tough areas.
