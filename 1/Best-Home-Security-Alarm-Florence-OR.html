The offers of free monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurance companies call into question the appropriateness of the present pattern in U.S. policing of enabling 3 or four complimentary false alarms per fiscal year, because they supply no up-front rewards to motivate owners to avoid false alarms.</p>
