<p>The Nest Web Cam IQ Outdoor is a lot more sophisticated security camera than the Deep Guard, and it's our top recommendation if you don't want to spend for that system's expensive (but arguably rewarding) human monitoring service.

<p>Just recently, Ring rejected reports that it had actually suffered an information breach, but we concur with its suggestion that users should reset passwords and enable two-factor authentication as a preventive procedure. All smart-home gadgets are susceptible to such incidents. Nevertheless, after this most current entry in a year-long series of questionable media reports, we have actually decided to pull our recommendation of Ring's video doorbells. If you plan to combine the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially read the What about Ring? area from our smart video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it pertains to video products, we don't think that these concerns change the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain positive in our current recommendation.</p>
