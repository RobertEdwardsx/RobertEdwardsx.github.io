Nowadays, it's much easier to have a standalone security camera. Whether you have one camera or a number of, they work with your home's web network to send video right to your computer or mobile phone. Most consumer cameras keep data internally, on a detachable microSD card, or from another location on the cloud.</p>

If you have big animals, you might wish to consider avoiding the motion sensing units and rely more on the window and door sensors which aren't set off by motion but are set off when a window or door is opened.</p>

The one time where lag does end up being a little bit of an issue is between recording and discovering movement. It takes a second for the camera to actually turn on when it discovers motion due to the fact that the Pro 2 does not do continuous video recording.

Which would then set off the burglar alarm if someone were to open the door that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be transferred.
