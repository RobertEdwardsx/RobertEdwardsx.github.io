<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky.

Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
