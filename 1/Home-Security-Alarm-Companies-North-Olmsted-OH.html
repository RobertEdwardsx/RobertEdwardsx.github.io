<p>Just recently, Ring denied reports that it had suffered a data breach, but we agree with its recommendation that users must reset passwords and enable two-factor authentication as a preventive measure. All smart-home gadgets are susceptible to such events. However, after this newest entry in a year-long series of controversial media reports, we have decided to pull our recommendation of Ring's video doorbells. If you prepare to match the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially read the What about Ring? section from our wise video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it concerns video products, we don't believe that these problems modify the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain confident in our present recommendation.</p>
