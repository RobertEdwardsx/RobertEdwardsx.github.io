<p>The best home security systems have expert monitoring. We understand it's an extra cost on a monthly basis, but we often advise it.

<p>After reading the discuss this page I went to Armorax's site to see what they provided; they have actually partnered with another security company and their starter bundle I believe starts at $0 down. The panel and sensors are Qolsys, so that's good. Monitoring is priced well too, so all in all a lot. In-home consultations are sales chances for security companies. These assessments can be very useful, but they can also sell you on a lot of equipment you didn't think you required (and probably still do not).</p>
<p>If you do encounter a home intrusion emergency situation, you can activate the 80dB alarm. I am somewhat disappointed by the volume of the alarm. At 80dB, it's about as loud as a food mill whereas many other alarm systems are as loud as 90dB and even 105dB. In spite of that, the alarm must be enough to frighten burglars most of the times. To recoup costs and hold alarm companies liable for incorrect alarms, Seattle works directly with your alarm company instead of with you. Your alarm company must be accredited, pay any registration or incorrect alarm charges, and offer physical evidence like camera video footage or a damaged window to require police action.</p>
