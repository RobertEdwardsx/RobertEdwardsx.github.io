<p>Pelco uses video surveillance cameras and video management solutions for commercial environments such as office complexes, shopping centers, others, and hotels. Some alarm serve a single purpose of theft protection; mix systems offer both fire and intrusion protection. Intrusion alarm systems may also be combined with closed-circuit tv surveillance (CCTV) systems to automatically tape-record the activities of burglars, and may user interface to gain access to control systems for electrically locked doors.

<p>A system that requires an agreement might be a clever choice for those who are cash-strapped or don't want to pay for the equipment up-front. Why? Due to the fact that contract-based security systems generally don't come with in advance fees. Rather, the expenses are expanded over the length of the contract. We've seen 1-year, all the way approximately 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we recommend contract-free systems if you do not want to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term contract (and who does?). Our pick: No contract.</p>

We must keep in mind that the camera would occasionally downgrade the picture quality based on readily available bandwidth, which might vary throughout the day. Nest consists of the option to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that may beat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>
