If you plan to combine the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially check out the What about Ring? section from our smart video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it concerns video products, we don't believe that these concerns change the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain positive in our existing recommendation.</p>

<p>The downside to a wireless system is that it depends on a wireless signal, implying that storms and strong winds have the power to interrupt the system and might even set off incorrect alarms. False alarms are known to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could lead to fines from the provider or the authorities if they take place frequently enough. Another possible disadvantage to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment need to be changed or charged regularly in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more costly than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is generally offset by the fact that there are no installation costs.</p>
