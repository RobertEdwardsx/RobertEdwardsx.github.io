But neither can tape constantly, and they both require the Ring Secure strategy to record recordings. Likewise, the wired variation usually left gaps of as much as 7 seconds in between 1-minute recordings, while the battery version left about a minute in between 30-second clips. Both also do not have person detection and geofencing, which other cameras use to minimize false notifies.</p>
