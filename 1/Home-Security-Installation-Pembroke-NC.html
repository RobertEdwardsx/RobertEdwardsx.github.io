<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to record clear video in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a brightened room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see at night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if catching video in the dark is a priority.</p>
<p>We tried each of the cameras in several locations around our house, ranging from 6 feet to 30 feet away from our Wi-Fi router, which was linked to Verizon Fios service.

Although FrontPoint provides a wide range of equipment and home automation products at a reasonable price, the one area where the company particularly excels is in DIY installation. </p>
