<p>6 basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. In a network injection attack, a hacker can make use of access points that are exposed to non-filtered network traffic, specifically transmitting network traffic such as Spanning Tree" (802.1 D), OSPF, RIP, and HSRP The hacker injects phony networking re-configuration commands that impact routers, switches, and smart centers.

The ordinance was modified and went into impact on June 1, 2013. Just like Vizzini's overuse of impossible" in The Princess Bride-to-be, home security companies like to toss around the word wireless" pretty freely. We get it.

<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that speak with an existing network should be within 300 feet for optimum efficiency. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's placement of the camera close to the NVR is certainly something to be taken into account. For example if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of a concern however if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on 2nd story wall, this would cause a disruption in the signal. A wireless bridge is a fantastic choice for long range scenarios where poles and trees are not present.</p>
