<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational data to a destructive enemy, since the interruption of the network prevents the flow of data and really indirectly protects data by preventing it from being sent. The normal reason for performing a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, during which all of the preliminary handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, supplying an opportunity for the malicious attacker to record these codes and use different cracking tools to evaluate security weak points and exploit them to get unauthorized access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools available which can introduce a dictionary style attack of "perhaps accepted" security keys based upon the "model" security essential captured throughout the network recovery.</p>
<p>Since they work using a digital signal which can be saved straight to a computer, these cameras do not need a video capture card.
