<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it provides protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software to discover it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only a false sense of security because it prevents only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>

<p>When using IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do nowadays - you will probably be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the large amount of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at really quick speeds, and frequently over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are trustworthy, but not compatible with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the need for additional wiring. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might require less wiring in the walls however will still require cable televisions to power the security camera independently, typically through 110VAC power. </p>
