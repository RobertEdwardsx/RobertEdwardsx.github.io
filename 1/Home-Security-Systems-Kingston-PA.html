<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>

It costs a lot, its pricing isn't constantly transparent, and it still has long contracts. Not to mention that the customer service experience varies commonly depending on the dealer you choose. </p>
