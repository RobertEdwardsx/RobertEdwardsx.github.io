<p>One important exception: ADT has a landline monitoring strategy that's $36.99 monthly, which might be an affordable option for consumers in rural areas. We advise cellular systems since they're far more secure than landline systems, however there are some locations where cellular monitoring isn't readily available. A landline system is still much better than no security at all if you live somewhere without access to cellular monitoring.</p>
<p>What to consider: Basic cellular alarm monitoring is $39.99 each month, however you'll pay a bit more if you wish to include extra functions, like a security camera. While a normal contract runs 42 months (among the longer agreement terms on our list), that requirement is just for users who want to rent their equipment. Vivint has no minimum agreement requirement if you buy your equipment upfront.</p>
<p>Activity notifications alert the user whenever significant activity is spotted near the camera. Learn if you can get notifications through push alerts, text, and or email.

And to be sincere, we're not terribly impressed by ADT's cameras in the very first place. What you're spending for is mainly that huge name in blue. </p>
