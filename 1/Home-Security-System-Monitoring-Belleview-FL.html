<p>The Piper NV is first and foremost a camera. It provides night vision and a wide-angle view so you can use one camera to monitor a big space.

<p>A lot of home security systems involve Do It Yourself installation of surveillance equipment, so I make certain that that's a simple procedure. I observe the procedure and make sure that the price isn't too high if a home security company only offers professional installation. Professional home security installation tends to skew upwards of $100, however it's actually your preference whether it's worth its substantial cost.</p>
<p>There's a few other cool features in the camera itself such as an automatic zoom which tracks moving items if it spots an intruder; a helpful intercom function that permits the gadget to serve as a wise doorbell (although it does not have a chime or button - for that you'll require the Nest Hello doorbell ); and, since Alphabet owns Nest, the camera brings Google Assistant.</p>

<p>The cover of darkness isn't enough to keep this late night lurker's identity hidden from Arlo's view. The one time where lag does end up being a little an issue is between finding and tape-recording movement. Since the Pro 2 doesn't do continuous video recording, it takes a second for the camera to in fact switch on when it discovers motion. They might get past the camera before it had time to tape them if a nefarious crook was quick enough.</p>

Not only does Vivint provide Alexa compatibilities, it likewise partnered with Google to offer Google Assistant voice control Every new smart home system includes 2 Google Home Minis.
