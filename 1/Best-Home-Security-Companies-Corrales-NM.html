It ended up being an incorrect alarm-- one she paid the local authorities $150 for.</p>

If the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits, which implies. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if somebody were to open the door that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be moved.
