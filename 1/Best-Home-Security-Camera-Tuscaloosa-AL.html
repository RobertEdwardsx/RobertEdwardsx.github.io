While some cameras still let you see a couple of days of tape-recorded video, the pattern has actually been to only let you enjoy live video from your camera unless you sign up for a membership. That means you can't recall a few hours or days to see who was walking through your lawn. And, most subscription plans also consist of additional functions, such as custom motion zones.</p>

<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it supplies protection just when the wireless device is "off the air".

Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only a false sense of security considering that it avoids only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
