However, you do require to register for the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 per month) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get signals on your phone if the sensors have actually been activated.

<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face notifies, which can determine individuals the camera is finding using face recognition. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to determine those individuals and will send mobile phone informs with that information when they appear at your home. We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to want to identify expected visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to determine faces on a nearby TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also supply a wider series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
