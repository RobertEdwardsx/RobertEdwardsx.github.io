As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally regular considering that the doorway and space seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
