Depending on distance and building materials, one or more wireless repeaters might be needed to bring the signal to the alarm panel reliably. A wireless system can be moved to a new home easily, a benefit for those who lease or who move often. The more vital wireless connection for security is the one in between the control panel and the monitoring station. Wireless monitoring of the alarm system secures against a burglar cutting a cable or from failures of an internet provider. This full wireless setup is typically described as 100% wireless.</p>
<p>Another benefit to monitored systems is if you acquire a monitored security plan, the same company that monitors the system will install it for you. Having an expert set up the system may offer you more confidence than if you did the work yourself if you're not mechanically inclined. Wireless cameras can't have all of it-- view things inside by day, and watch on what's going on outside after dark. It hardly ever works.</p>

The camera includes features like free streamable HD video and audio, 30-day storage, and night vision, however it does not take pictures of activity and can't move or pan-- basic functions found on the majority of surveillance cameras. </p>
