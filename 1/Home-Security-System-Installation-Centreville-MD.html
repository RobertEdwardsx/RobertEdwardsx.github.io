<p>CCTV cameras are placed in locations where they are believed to be most efficient, which typically includes extremely populated towns, town hall, parking area, or numerous other high-crime areas (Welsh and Farrington 2008). Given that the positioning of these cameras is extremely essential, the criminal activity patterns in areas of interest are usually studied for time periods to identify crime hotspots where cameras might possibly be positioned.

<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life span, however outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, much of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the extreme environment.</p>
<p>When I ultimately entered the camera controls, I was reasonably satisfied. The camera quality isn't half bad, there's a solid night-vision mode, and all the app controls are fairly obvious. You have actually got two-way audio, you can play melodies just to let the individual being seen understand they're being watched, and you can choose to tape video clips or images and save them to your clever device on an impulse. </p>
