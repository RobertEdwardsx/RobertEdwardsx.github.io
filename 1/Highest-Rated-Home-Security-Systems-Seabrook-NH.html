<p>Are privately owned, operated surveillance cameras to be dealt with the exact same way as public cameras? We also need to draw great lines about 'Who actually is watching you'? 'Who owns that camera anyhow'? Huge sibling? The Corporates? Or bothering neighbour? Who fixes a limit between public interest and harassment? At the moment, no one! The camera could lawfully do what a peeping tom might refrain from doing. They might peer inside of windows with the full protection of the law on their side. If a person was standing viewing outside a window it might be a criminal activity, yet the exact same individual could put a surveillance camera then from another location see a person within the privacy of their home. Most importantly, it is not versus the chastening code.</p>
