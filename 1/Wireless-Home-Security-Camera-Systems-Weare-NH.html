<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally regular since the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as consumers realize that the inexpensive customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally too late considering that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>

It costs a lot, its rates isn't constantly transparent, and it still has long contracts. Not to discuss that the client service experience varies commonly depending on the dealership you go with. </p>
