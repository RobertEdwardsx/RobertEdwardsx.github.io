<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the harsh environment.</p>
<p>The report, entitled Is your CCTV system secure from cyber attack?, says there are "major vulnerabilities" in both standard DVR-based CCTV systems, as well as cloud-based video systems. Hackers can "quickly" pirate connections to the gadget's IP address, putting a great deal of people, their properties and information at threat. </p>
