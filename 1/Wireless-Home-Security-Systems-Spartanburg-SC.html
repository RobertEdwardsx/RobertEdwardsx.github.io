<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," allowing them to capture clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a brightened space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if catching video in the dark is a concern.</p>
