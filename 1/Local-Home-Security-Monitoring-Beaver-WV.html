<p>For these different systems to assemble or to incorporate them together into a single interface, an in-depth knowledge of all the needed systems is necessary. If there are no as-built files offering performance and configuration information to make this combination work, there are only two options. The first option, which may be the most intricate, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the initial solution provider is not available or reluctant to offer those information) and document the geography and how they can be integrated into the new DVS system.
