<p>For these separate systems to converge or to integrate them together into a single interface, a detailed knowledge of all the required systems is necessary. If there are no as-built documents supplying performance and setup information to make this integration work, there are just two options. The first alternative, which might be the most intricate, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the original service provider is unavailable or unwilling to supply those details) and record the geography and how they can be incorporated into the new DVS system.

<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the severe environment.</p>
