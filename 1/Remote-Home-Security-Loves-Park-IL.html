<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we might point them at the exact same area and expose them all to the very same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting components, which I had actually installed on the porch by a certified electrician (who takes place to be my hubby).

<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face informs, which can identify people the camera is identifying using face recognition. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name.

We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to distinguish predicted visitors from random strangers. We also found the feature to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to identify faces on a nearby TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also offer a broader series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
