<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face informs, which can determine individuals the camera is finding utilizing face acknowledgment. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name.

We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to want to identify predicted visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was always asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also provide a broader range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
