<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, most alarm systems work the exact same way. They use open and closed circuits to move an electrical existing. When this electrical current is not being moved it triggers a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if somebody were to open the door that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be moved. However, in an open circuit security system, unlocking permits the electrical current to stream throughout the system, which indicates when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will set off.</p>
