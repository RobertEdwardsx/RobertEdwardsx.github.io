<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it supplies protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" freely transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software application to identify it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just a false sense of security given that it avoids just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>

<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face signals, which can recognize people the camera is spotting utilizing face acknowledgment. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to identify those people and will send out smart device signals with that details when they appear at your home. We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to want to identify expected visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to determine faces on a nearby TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) likewise supply a wider series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
