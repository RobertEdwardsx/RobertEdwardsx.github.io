<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't decide to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as alerts that distinguish between individuals and basic motion. We think that's expensive.</p>
