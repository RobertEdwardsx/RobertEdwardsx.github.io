<p>When using IP cameras - as a lot of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will most likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the big quantity of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at extremely fast speeds, and typically over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reliable, however not suitable with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the need for further electrical wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might need less circuitry in the walls but will still need cables to power the security camera individually, normally through 110VAC power. </p>
