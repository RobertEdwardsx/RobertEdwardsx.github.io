<h3>Alarm Security System Companies in New Fairfield CT</h3>
<p>Customer service is typically overlooked in an industry like this where people do not believe they're ever going to speak with their alarm company. We have first hand experience dealing with these companies (as clients ourselves) and firmly believe that client service is extremely important. Especially for a DIY install system, having the ability to get the phone and get a security consultant on the line quickly to help you get setup or troubleshoot an issue, is critical.</p>
<p>Most of the self-monitored starter sets do not consist of outdoor cameras. Outdoor cameras are a little bit more difficult to install given that they have to be installed to a home. Outside security cameras are likewise more costly given that they are made to stand up to the elements. In an effort to keep starter packages easy to install and affordable, they're often neglected of the basic packages.</p>
<p>In an effort to minimize incorrect alarms, the city charges charges for incorrect alarms. Businesses and homeowners in Plymouth need to also register their alarm systems that are centrally monitored. There is no charge to register your system. Commercial users are permitted one false alarm per calendar year with no charges and residential users are enabled 2 incorrect alarms per calendar year.</p>
<p>We don't hide equipment fees by rolling them into a high regular monthly rate. At Smith Thompson Security we believe the right thing to do is, is to show you the price of the equipment and monitoring rate individually. That way you REALLY know what you're spending. Even if you benefit from our 12 months like money funding option, when it's settled, all you have left is our low month-to-month monitoring rate.</p>

And because ADT offers exact same- and next-day installation, you can get that additional security in no time, which appears like good value.</p>
