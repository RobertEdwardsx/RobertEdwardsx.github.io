<p>Nothing is more important than securing what you treasure most ... your family and home. The implicit reason for the recent push to increase video surveillance is the danger of terrorist attacks. However suicide enemies are plainly not hindered by camera - and might even be drawn in to the television protection cameras can make sure - and the expenditure of a comprehensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up approximately 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice budget plan - far surpasses the restricted advantages that the system may provide in investigating attacks or attempted attacks after the fact (see reality sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
