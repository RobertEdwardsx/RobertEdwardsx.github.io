<p>Nevertheless, wired systems aren't without their disadvantages. They tend to be more pricey to install, needing the competence of certified experts. As facilities, sensors and circuitry need to be positioned inside the walls, which involves drilling and linking sensing units to low-voltage wires, so there's contractor labor to think about. Uninstalling, re-installing a system and moving is usually inadvisable and particularly bothersome, because it means putting old hardware in a new place.</p>
<p>Arlo Pro 2 also has a remarkable Night Vision feature. It is equipped with infrared lenses that allow the camera to tape-record videos even in total darkness. It has about 25 feet of exposure during the night. As such, even if someone get into your home in complete darkness, you'll still be able to see them in your mobile phone app. The only concern here is that the tape-recorded video will be black and white and a little dark so you may not have the ability to see information clearly.</p>

Some helpful people enjoy this approach, others not so much, but it generally doesn't matter due to the fact that the process is rather basic.
