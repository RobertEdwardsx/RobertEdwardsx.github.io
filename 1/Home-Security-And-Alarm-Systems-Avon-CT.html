The innovation slowly developed into the highly advanced yet budget friendly systems readily available today. The very first usages of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the ways to tape video and see it later on. Although video surveillance was monitored out of need in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to enhance the outcome of security systems.</p>
