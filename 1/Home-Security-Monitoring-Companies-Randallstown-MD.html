<p>The Nest Web cam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were excellent in our screening-- throughout the day and at night-- with a broad, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video. We ought to keep in mind that the camera would occasionally downgrade the photo quality based on offered bandwidth, which might fluctuate throughout the day. Nest includes the alternative to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that might beat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>
