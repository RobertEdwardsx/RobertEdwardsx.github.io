<p>Are independently owned, operated surveillance cameras to be treated the exact same way as public cameras? We likewise need to draw great lines about 'Who really is enjoying you'? 'Who owns that camera anyway'? Big bro? The Corporates? Or pestering neighbour? Who fixes a limit between public interest and harassment? At the minute, no one! The camera might legally do what a peeping tom could not do. They might peer within windows with the full protection of the law on their side. If a person was standing watching outside a window it could be a criminal offense, yet the very same person might put a surveillance camera then remotely view an individual within the personal privacy of their home. Most importantly, it is not against the penal code.</p>
<p>The SimpliSafe equipment is now in its 3rd variation, with a simpler and more trendy design for both app and devices. The base station is curvier and the sensors are smaller, but the range is better, promising connections to wireless sensing units up to 800 feet away. We didn't go that far, but we had the ability to tackle 40 feet in different instructions, through walls to areas in the cooking area and dining-room. </p>
