Lots of websites needing alarm installations no longer have standard telephone lines (POTS), and alarm panels with conventional telephone dialer ability do not work reliably over some kinds of VoIP service.</p>
<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face notifies, which can determine people the camera is spotting utilizing face recognition. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name.

We believe this feature (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to identify expected visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to determine faces on a close-by TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also provide a wider variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
