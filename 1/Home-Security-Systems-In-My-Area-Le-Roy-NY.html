<p>The Nest Web cam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were remarkable in our testing-- during the day and at night-- with a large, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video. We need to note that the camera would occasionally downgrade the image quality based upon offered bandwidth, which could vary throughout the day. Nest includes the alternative to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, however that might defeat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>

With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's placement of the camera close to the NVR is certainly something to be taken into consideration. For instance if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of a problem but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on 2nd story wall, this would trigger an interruption in the signal. A wireless bridge is a great alternative for long range scenarios where trees and poles are not present.</p>
<p>There's no devoted center involved here - each camera links directly to your router via Wi-Fi, and streams to your phone (or to the outside world) from there. That's a cool service, or at least one that conserves a power socket and an Ethernet port, however we can't assist however feel it's likewise the reason for the Swann's slightly sluggish response times.</p>
