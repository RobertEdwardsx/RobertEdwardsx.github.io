<p>I discussed that all we would need to do is take advantage of any among the emergency call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which likewise consisted of two-way audio, which camera would become the user interface into the VMS system. When a patient presses the emergency button, it sends out dual informs: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Moreover, if the main patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, showing that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would examine the danger and, if needed, could merely push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific flooring.</p>
