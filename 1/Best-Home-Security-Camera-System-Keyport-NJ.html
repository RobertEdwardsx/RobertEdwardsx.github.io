<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely typical because the doorway and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of catching video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
