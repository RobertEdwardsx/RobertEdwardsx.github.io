Many also provide support for IFTTT (If This Then That) applets, which use triggers from IFTTT-compatible web services and devices to create an action.

<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a brightened space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see in the evening. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if capturing footage in the dark is a priority.</p>
