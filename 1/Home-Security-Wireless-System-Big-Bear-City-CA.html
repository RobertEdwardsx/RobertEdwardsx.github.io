<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it provides protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software application to identify it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only a false sense of security considering that it avoids just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
