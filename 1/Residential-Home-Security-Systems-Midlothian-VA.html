<p>Just a couple years earlier, the home security industry was dominated by a few big names providing costly, rigid strategies with little flexibility and hostile, long-term agreements. Systems were limited to a couple wired motion sensing units linked to a keypad control board and go through a landline. Nowadays, this has actually all altered.

<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's simple to sign in on the kids; 2- and four-legged alike. We initially saw Wyze because its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E But once we attempted it out, it quickly ended up being a personnel (and family and friends) fave. I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a noise maker. It can't send signals, you can't control it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
