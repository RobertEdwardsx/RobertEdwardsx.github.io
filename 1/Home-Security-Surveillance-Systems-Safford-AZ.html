<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the large amount of data required by digital video and high resolutions at extremely quick speeds, and typically over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reputable, but not compatible with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, eliminating the need for additional electrical wiring.

Wireless security cameras may require less wiring in the walls however will still require cable televisions to power the security camera individually, usually through 110VAC power. </p>
