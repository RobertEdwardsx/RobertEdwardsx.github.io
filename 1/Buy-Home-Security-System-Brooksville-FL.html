<p>While you have to pay for cloud video storage on the Arlo Pro 3, it is among the more cost effective memberships out there at $2.99 a month. This is an expensive security camera, but we believe it deserves the financial investment.

We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to want to identify expected visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the function to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also provide a larger series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
