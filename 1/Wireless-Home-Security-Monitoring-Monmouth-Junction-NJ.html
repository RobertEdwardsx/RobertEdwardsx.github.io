<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that compare individuals and general motion. We think that's expensive.</p>

The previous, more affordable variation of the outdoor Nest webcam is still on sale too if you want to conserve some cash - it does have a cable connected though, rather than working wirelessly, which implies it's a bit much easier to mess up for potential intruders.
