<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and then combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely typical because the doorway and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as clients understand that the economical customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's typically far too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
