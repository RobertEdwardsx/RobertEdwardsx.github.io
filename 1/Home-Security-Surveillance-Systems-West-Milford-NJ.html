When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to identify those individuals and will send mobile phone informs with that details when they appear at your home. We think this feature (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to want to distinguish anticipated visitors from random complete strangers.
