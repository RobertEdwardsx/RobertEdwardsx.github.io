Image resolution: A lot of outdoor cameras stream 1080p video. If a camera does just 720p, you shouldn't be paying more than $100.</p>
<p>The Nest Camera Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were remarkable in our testing-- during the day and at night-- with a large, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that permitted us to get a closer view in live video. We ought to note that the camera would sometimes downgrade the photo quality based on offered bandwidth, which could fluctuate throughout the day. Nest includes the option to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, however that might defeat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>

<p>Bullet cameras are one of the 2 most typical CCTV camera types. They have a long round shape, giving them their name and a distinct appearance. This appearance is recognizable to nearly everybody and hence acts as a deterrent to undesirable people. The hope is bad guys and burglars go elsewhere instead if security cameras are noticeable.

<p>What actually sets this design apart is Nest Aware, a subscription service that can be pricey but is essential.
