<p>The Nest Camera Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were remarkable in our testing-- during the day and at night-- with a large, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that permitted us to get a closer view in live video. We ought to note that the camera would sometimes downgrade the photo quality based on offered bandwidth, which could fluctuate throughout the day.

<p>What actually sets this design apart is Nest Aware, a subscription service that can be pricey but is essential.
