<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, a lot of burglar alarms work the specific very same method. They utilize open and closed circuits to move an electric present. When this electrical current is not being transferred it sets off an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if someone were to open the door that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be moved.
