<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to sign in on the kids; 2- and four-legged alike. We initially observed Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E Once we attempted it out, it quickly ended up being a personnel (and family and friends) favorite.
