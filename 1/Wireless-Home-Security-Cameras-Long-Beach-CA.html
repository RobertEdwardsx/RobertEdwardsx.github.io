<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face informs, which can determine people the camera is finding utilizing face recognition. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to recognize those people and will send mobile phone alerts with that info when they appear at your home. We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to differentiate anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also provide a broader range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
