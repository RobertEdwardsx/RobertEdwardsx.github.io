<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that distinguish between individuals and basic motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>
