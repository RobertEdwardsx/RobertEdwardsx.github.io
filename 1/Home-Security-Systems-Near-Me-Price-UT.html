<p>Thanks to current improvements in technology, wireless security systems are now as reliable as wired systems If you've made the decision to install an alarm system, you need to consider the following advantages of wireless innovation. By combining LiveWatch DIY security systems with Moni's expert monitoring, we can see Brinks Home Security competing with other big names in the market.

Get home security and smart home automation without all the agreements and regular monthly costs.</p>
<p>Today you can get 20% off your SimpliSafe equipment plan when you pick the Interactive Monitoring strategy at checkout. That's almost $100 off the most costly package, The Haven-- putting it at simply under $400 total.
