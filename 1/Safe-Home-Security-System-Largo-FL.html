ADT offers you great deals of alternatives. You can lease a system from them or buy monitoring for an existing system. They can monitor equipment made by a lot of the leading brand names. They support a complete spectrum of wireless security features, including video monitoring, home automation, sensors to avoid an environmental disaster, and medical informs.
