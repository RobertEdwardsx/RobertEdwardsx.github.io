<p>The cover of darkness isn't adequate to keep this late night lurker's identity hidden from Arlo's view. The one time where lag does end up being a bit of an issue is between tape-recording and discovering movement.

<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it supplies protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software application to identify it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies only a false sense of security since it prevents only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
