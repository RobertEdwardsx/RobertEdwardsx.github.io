<p>When set off, burglar alarms most frequently do seven main jobs. The first job is the alert of a siren, this enables everyone in your area consisting of the homeowners or company owner to understand that an intruder has been spotted. The 2nd job is flashing outdoor lights. Not all alarm systems have flashing outdoor lights however the most common burglar alarms and some of the advanced ones do.

Being able to distinguish between a car and a person, for example, permits you to reduce unneeded alerts.
