<p>The Nest Cam Indoor is the 3rd generation of the renowned Dropcam-- one of the first, and among the very best home security cameras-- and bumps up its predecessors' video quality to 1080p. It's easy to set up and, thanks to its magnetic, swiveling base, it can be installed practically anywhere indoors. The video looks sharp; night vision is clear; the camera can be utilized as an intercom; and it engages with the Nest Thermostat and the Nest Protect smoke alarm, in addition to many third-party clever- home devices. But to really use the camera's functions, you'll need to shell out $10 or more per month for the Nest Aware program, which offers you access to cloud storage, individual detection and customizable activity zones.</p>

It costs a lot, its pricing isn't constantly transparent, and it still has long contracts. Not to discuss that the customer care experience differs commonly depending upon the dealership you opt for. </p>
