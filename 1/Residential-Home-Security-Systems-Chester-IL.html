<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product category is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security professionals investigating Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. The smart bit is that the camera not only finds that individuals have actually entered its 130-degree visual field, however it will also have a stab at identifying them too. Perhaps more usefully, if somebody passes who the camera doesn't know, you get an alert about an "unknown face". You can inform the system who it is (if it's not an intruder), and next time around it must immediately know.</p>

<p>We likewise look at the features that are offered through the camera's app. Does it have such things as personalized motion zones?

The field of view is a narrow 110 degrees (compared with 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). Nevertheless, after nearly 2 years of night, usage and day images have always been clear, and we never had issues with the camera missing out on motion, a problem we encountered when evaluating the Wyze Cam Pan And for those times when you're left questioning why your camera sent out a motion alert, Wyze has a clever feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It creates a green, on-screen box around the motion found.

<p>Think of it this way, if a good still-camera costs a minimum of two hundred and fifty dollars (US $), how can a more advanced video camera be cost the low price of forty dollars? It simply does not build up. To provide such low prices, manufacturers should cut corners, and completion result is compromised efficiency. What good is a surveillance camera that only works ideally in ideal conditions like bright sunlight? Consumer-grade cameras can work well in certain scenarios such as nanny cameras or checking in on a family pet, though when seeking to collect evidence of a crime they frequently come up short.</p>
