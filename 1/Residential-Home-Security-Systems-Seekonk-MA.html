<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it supplies protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software to discover it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only an incorrect complacency since it prevents just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
