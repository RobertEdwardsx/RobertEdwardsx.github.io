<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally normal given that the doorway and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once consumers realize that the inexpensive customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
