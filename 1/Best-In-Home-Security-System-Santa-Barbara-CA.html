<p>Everything about Security provides professional, trustworthy alarm monitoring services for homes and companies throughout the greater Indianapolis area. The more advanced cameras in the market permit two-way audio between people on either side of the video surveillance system. When carried out properly, two-way audio is a function with tons of applications - security and non-security. This includes background music services, delivering help-desk assistance remotely, enhancing loss avoidance, monitoring high-traffic areas, aggressiveness detection, and targeted retail messaging.</p>
<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents speaking with somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is activated. Let's face it, false alarms are relatively common. If a homeowner forgets their secrets and goes back inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensor is activated by an area feline, it can set off the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the homeowner will be called by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it rapidly. Incorrect alarms take place. With a self-monitored system, a homeowner will not get calls from a monitoring company. Instead, property owners access the alarm themselves and take the required action.</p>

<p>I have this camera connected to my desktop as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cable, I was able location the camera around 10 feet away from my desk aiming into my corridor. The security program I use is "blue iris" which had the ability to find the camera without problem. The IR lights in the evening are able to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not nearly as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, however it was half the rate and it doesn't eat up my wifi bandwidth.</p>
