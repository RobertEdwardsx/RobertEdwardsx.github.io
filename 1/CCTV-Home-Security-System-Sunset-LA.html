<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not fantastic-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion activates.</p>

<p>The 2nd important thing to say is that the Arlo Pro 2 has a surprisingly ear-piercing inbuilt alarm, so it functions as a home alarm system in addition to a security camera. That differentiates it from the items I've already written, and helps in part to explain its cost. This Canary Flex is a home security camera that loads a huge punch in a little package.

<p>For example, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies designed their equipment by doing this to make consumers stick with them longer, since switching monitoring companies means numerous dollars down the drain and a huge headache for clients.
