<p>Your CCTV camera may make you feel physically more secure, but after reading this short article, it will sure make you feel virtually vulnerable. On the simpler side, with SimpliSafe, you trade the bells and whistles of clever home equipment for versatility and low prices. SimpliSafe does have a video doorbell with two-way audio, but you can't add a lots of other clever home tech to the system. It will not deal with loads of wise home equipment from other companies. The app is hugely excellent, and while the level of control doesn't match SmartThings, producing 'Actions' - such as turning the hall light on when you open the front door, or showing up the heat when you journey the motion sensing unit in the early morning - are refreshingly easy.</p>
<p>We didn't think about alarm systems that needed professional installation. Pro-installed systems usually cost more, usage equipment similar to that of DIY systems, come with long and generally difficult contracts, and often rely on the same monitoring companies that self-installed systems utilize, so they offer little advantage. A fine example is the Vivint system, which we've examined independently and do not suggest for many people.</p>

Now, most security systems involve a variety of elements, such as a base station, security camera, glass, motion, and entry break sensors, a keypad, and key fobs, among other parts.

Whatever the parts are (camera, motion sensing unit, window sensing unit, wise lock, etc.), I want to make certain that they all easily interact with your app that is constantly at hand, so you can watch on them from afar.</p>
