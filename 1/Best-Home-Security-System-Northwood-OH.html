<p>Basically, the Nest camera sits anywhere you put it and records what it sees, saving the last five days of video footage to the cloud. The large face of the camera offers you an impressive visual field, and the image you get is of good quality (you can alter the resolution; the better it gets, the more information you'll use to save it to the cloud.)

<p>The Google Nest Webcam IQ Outdoor is the most highly sophisticated outdoor camera we've checked. It has a close-up tracking function, which automatically zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high vibrant variety), and 12 x digital zoom. It can compare basic motion and people, so it cuts down on false alarms, and it can even determine individuals you've identified (after a knowing period). However like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>
<p>What really sets this design apart is Nest Aware, a subscription service that can be expensive but is vital. In truth, we do not recommend purchasing this camera at all unless you plan to include the subscription. Without it, you will not get the person-detection function, customizable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of vision), or Sightline, a detailed, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera discovered activity. Having the ability to compare an individual and a car, for instance, permits you to cut down on unneeded notifies. And Activity Zones are a nice perk, especially if you're seeking to monitor a specific corner of the backyard, a doorway, and even garbage cans. </p>
