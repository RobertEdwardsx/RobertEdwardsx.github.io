Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to identify any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensors to disregard items that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires.
