<p>After checking out the comments on this page I went to Armorax's website to see what they used; they've partnered with another security company and their starter package I believe starts at $0 down.

<h3>Security Camera Equipment in Providence UT</h3>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
