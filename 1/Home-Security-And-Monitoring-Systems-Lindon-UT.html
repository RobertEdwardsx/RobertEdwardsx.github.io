<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids talking with somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, false alarms are fairly common. If a house owner forgets their secrets and returns inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensor is set off by a community feline, it can set off the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the house owner will be called by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the property owner disables it rapidly. Incorrect alarms happen. With a self-monitored system, a property owner won't receive calls from a monitoring company. Rather, property owners access the alarm themselves and take the needed action.</p>

<p>The price of admission for the Deep Sentinel Home Security system isn't that steep, even at $499, since it consists of three outdoor cameras with two-way audio. And the $50-per-month subscription cost sounds costly, however it's not so much when you consider that a live human being is viewing a live feed whenever the cameras spot suspicious activity. That individual at Deep Guard's facility can alert a suspicious person that they're being observed, and they can call your local cops dispatcher if they refuse to leave or engage in a criminal act. It's not for everyone, but it's the best DIY outdoor security camera we've seen to date.</p>
