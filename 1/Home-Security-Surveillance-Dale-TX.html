<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  If you want to get out of the contract you need to pay 75% of the contract.  So I still have 21 months of a contract I had no idea I was in, to go out I have to pay $783.  Actually frustrating. Again the sales people, or a minimum of mine, do not mention the 3 year commitment. I called their customer support team and they acknowledged that the sales people do not have to discuss it, it's on you to read the small print. I'm paying the swelling amount, since obviously they vehicle restore you eventually unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send in a written not by mail.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion triggers.</p>

The one time where lag does become a little an issue is between tape-recording and detecting movement. Because the Pro 2 does not do constant video recording, it takes a second for the camera to actually switch on when it detects motion. If a nefarious criminal was fast enough, they might get past the camera prior to it had time to record them.</p>
