The previous, more affordable variation of the outdoor Nest webcam is still on sale too if you want to save some cash - it does have actually a cable connected however, instead of working wirelessly, which suggests it's a bit much easier to sabotage for prospective trespassers. Absolutely one of the best security cameras in 2020.</p>
