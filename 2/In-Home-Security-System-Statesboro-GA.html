<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely typical considering that the doorway and space seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everybody going into the shop.
