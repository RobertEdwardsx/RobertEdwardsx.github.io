<p>This awesome clever alarm has a motion detector and siren in one gadget.

<p>As you weigh your security options, make sure you're not disregarding the security essentials. Why bother getting that expensive alarm if you consistently leave the front door unlocked and have such dim lighting that a camera can't tape a clear image anyway?
