Just like Vizzini's overuse of impossible" in The Princess Bride, home security companies like to throw around the word wireless" pretty freely. We get it. It's a buzzword that offers the benefit of equipment without any strings connected. However wireless" can actually suggest a couple of various things for a home security system, and it can get complicated.</p>
<p>There's a couple of other cool functions in the camera itself such as an automatic zoom which tracks moving things if it finds an intruder; a handy intercom function that permits the gadget to act as a clever doorbell (although it doesn't have a chime or button - for that you'll require the Nest Hello doorbell ); and, because Alphabet owns Nest, the camera brings Google Assistant.</p>

Now, a lot of security systems involve a variety of parts, such as a base station, security camera, motion, entry, and glass break sensors, a keypad, and key fobs, to name a few parts. But I also appreciate minimalist systems that components that carry out more than one action, like Minut. Some components can make home automation available to you. Whatever the elements are (camera, motion sensor, window sensing unit, smart lock, etc.), I want to make certain that they all easily communicate with your app that is always at hand, so you can watch on them from afar.</p>
