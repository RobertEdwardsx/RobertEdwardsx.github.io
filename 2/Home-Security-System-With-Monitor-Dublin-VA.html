<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's simple to check in on the kids; 2- and four-legged alike. We initially discovered Wyze because its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E But once we tried it out, it quickly became a personnel (and friends and family) favorite. I do not suggest SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a noise maker. It can't send alerts, you can't control it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>

Nevertheless, there were some concerns with connecting the command center to our tester's network. </p>
