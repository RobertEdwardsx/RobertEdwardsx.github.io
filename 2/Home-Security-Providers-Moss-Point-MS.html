<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely normal since the entrance and room seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of catching video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as clients realize that the affordable customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's normally too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
