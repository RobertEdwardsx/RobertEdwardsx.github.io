<p>Because it's more complex than it must be, we don't advise the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, informs, and integration all need different IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly cost (or $80 each year) to keep 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limitations, we often found action missing out on, thanks to inconsistent and lengthy spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>

<p>Are privately owned, operated surveillance cameras to be treated the same way as public cameras? We also need to draw fine lines about 'Who really is viewing you'? 'Who owns that camera anyway'? Big bro? The Corporates? Or pestering neighbour? Who fixes a limit between public interest and harassment? At the moment, nobody! The camera could lawfully do what a peeping tom could refrain from doing. They might peer inside of windows with the complete protection of the law on their side. If a person was standing viewing outside a window it might be a criminal offense, yet the very same person might put a surveillance camera then from another location view an individual within the personal privacy of their home. Most notably, it is not against the penal code.</p>
<p>The Wyze Web cam's motion tracking is also cool-- if a kid or pet goes through the space, the camera will follow all the action. (No more arguments about who broke the lamp.) Plus, you can get the Wyze Cam for under $40. Can't decide which ADT monitored security system is best for you and your family?
