Much like Vizzini's overuse of impossible" in The Princess Bride-to-be, home security companies like to throw around the word wireless" quite freely. We get it. It's a buzzword that sells the convenience of equipment without any strings connected. But wireless" can in fact mean a couple of various things for a home security system, and it can get confusing.</p>
<p>The Police Department is asking locals and services throughout the city to register their independently owned surveillance camera systems.

A lot of companies charge an installation cost and a monthly monitoring charge. Some companies likewise impose a cancellation charge. Installation and monitoring charges can be waived for DIY systems, however an activation cost may use.
