<p>However, in any situation where standard-definition camera are utilized, the quality is going to be poor because the maximum pixel resolution of the image chips in the majority of these gadgets is 320,000 pixels (analogue quality is determined in TELEVISION lines however the results are the very same); they generally catch vertical and horizontal fields of lines and mix them together to make a single frame; the optimum frame rate is normally 30 frames per second.</p>
<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the severe environment.</p>
