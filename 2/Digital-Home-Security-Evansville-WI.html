<p>The disadvantage to a wireless system is that it depends on a wireless signal, meaning that storms and strong winds have the power to interfere with the system and could even set off false alarms. Incorrect alarms are known to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could result in fines from the provider or the cops if they occur often enough. Another possible disadvantage to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool must be replaced or charged regularly in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can likewise be more expensive than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is usually offset by the reality that there are no installation expenses.</p>
