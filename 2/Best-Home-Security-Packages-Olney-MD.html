We first noticed Wyze due to the fact that its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E But once we attempted it out, it rapidly became a staff (and family and friends) favorite. I do not suggest SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a sound maker. It can't send out signals, you can't control it from another location, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>

You've got two-way audio, you can play tunes just to let the individual being viewed understand they're being enjoyed, and you can select to tape video clips or pictures and conserve them to your wise device on a whim. </p>
