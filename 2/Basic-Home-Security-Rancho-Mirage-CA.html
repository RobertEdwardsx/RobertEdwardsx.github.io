<p>We have actually long been fans of the Netatmo Invite camera (₤ 199), with its downplayed looks and face recognition software. The latter allows you to see exactly when a specific individual arrives at your house - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner appeared on time.
