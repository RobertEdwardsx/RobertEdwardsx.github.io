<p>A tight wire border security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to identify any physical attempt to permeate the barrier.

This kind of system is susceptible to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is set up to prevent this type of attack.</p>
