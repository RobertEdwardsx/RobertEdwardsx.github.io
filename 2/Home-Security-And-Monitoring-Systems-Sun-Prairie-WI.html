<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally regular given that the entrance and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as clients realize that the economical customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally too late considering that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>

Yes, a video surveillance camera in public locations is good - it helps in crime-prevention and works as a deterrent. Post crime investigation is easy and capturing perpetrators is easy for law-enforcement officers. </p>
