We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that compare individuals and general motion.
