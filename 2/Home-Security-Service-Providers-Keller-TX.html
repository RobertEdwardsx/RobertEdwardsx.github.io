<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can recognize individuals the camera is finding using face acknowledgment. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to identify those individuals and will send out smartphone informs with that details when they appear at your home. We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to want to distinguish expected visitors from random strangers. We also found the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also provide a wider variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
