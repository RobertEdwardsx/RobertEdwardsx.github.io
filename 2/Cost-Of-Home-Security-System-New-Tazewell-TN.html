<p>6 basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Of all the home security system offered on the market today, there is not one that looks more classy and sophisticated than Nest Secure. Every piece of equipment has somewhat curved, delicate edges, combined with a really contemporary, futuristic appearance. Even the colors of white, blue and green are mixed cleanly and appealingly.

<p>A system that needs an agreement may be a wise option for those who are cash-strapped or don't want to spend for the equipment up-front. Why? Because contract-based security systems generally do not come with upfront costs. Rather, the costs are expanded over the length of the contract. We have actually seen 1-year, all the way as much as 5-year agreements! On the other hand, we advise contract-free systems if you do not want to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting arrangement (and who does?). Our choice: No contract.</p>

<p>Having animals implies you will need to consider their size, movements, and any other elements that could trigger problems. For example, if you have pets that are over 30 pounds, you will need a security system whose motion sensing units can be changed or a system that can be installed in such a method that your big pets won't cause false alarms to be sent every time your family pet moves. If you have large animals, you might wish to consider skipping the motion sensing units and rely more on the window and door sensors which aren't set off by movement however are triggered when a window or door is opened.</p>
