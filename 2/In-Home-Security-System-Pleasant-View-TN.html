<p>After we used the Anker EufyCam for almost six months, we're shocked to report that it is on track to provide on its promise of as much as one year of battery life. What we do not love is that it leaves gaps in between recordings, which ranged anywhere from 4 to 34 seconds, depending upon the settings. We have actually discovered some improvements since the camera's launch, and will continue to update this evaluation and test, as needed.</p>
<p>After reading the discuss this page I went to Armorax's site to see what they used; they've partnered with another security company and their starter package I believe starts at $0 down.

The company depends on long-lasting contracts (although they do use discounts along with some long-term agreements), uses no professional installation choice, no landline alternative, and has the greatest month-to-month monitoring costs of all the companies we evaluated.</p>
