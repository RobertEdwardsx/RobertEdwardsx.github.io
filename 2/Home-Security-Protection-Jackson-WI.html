The second job is flashing outdoor lights. Not all burglar alarms have flashing outdoor lights but the most typical burglar alarms and a few of the advanced ones do. The most typical sort of alarm system have an auto dialer which alerts police in the location to dispatch to business or the home that is being broken into.
