<p>After we used the Anker EufyCam for almost six months, we're shocked to report that it is on track to deliver on its promise of up to one year of battery life.

<p>However monitored systems likewise tend to have a service contract, which locks you into paying an often-pricey month-to-month fee for a set amount of time, normally one to 5 years. No-contract systems, which permit you to spend for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis instead of dedicating to a long-term plan, are ending up being more typical. These systems in some cases cost more up front for the hardware than professional systems that use a discount in exchange for that prolonged service arrangement.

And you can begin and stop the monitoring service as sometimes as you want.</p>
