Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are kept for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month cost (or $80 each year) to store 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limitations, we often discovered action missing out on, thanks to irregular and prolonged spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
