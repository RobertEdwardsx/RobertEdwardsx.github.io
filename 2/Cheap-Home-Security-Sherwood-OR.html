<p>But monitored systems also tend to have a service agreement, which locks you into paying an often-pricey month-to-month cost for a set amount of time, typically one to five years. No-contract systems, which permit you to spend for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis instead of devoting to a long-term plan, are becoming more common. These systems often cost more in advance for the hardware than professional systems that provide a discount rate in exchange for that prolonged service agreement. Paying for the equipment in advance offers you with a lot of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you utilize the service. And you can start and stop the monitoring service as many times as you desire.</p>
