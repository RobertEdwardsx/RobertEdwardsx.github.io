<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that speak to an existing network needs to be within 300 feet for ideal performance. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera near the NVR is absolutely something to be considered. For example if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of a concern however if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on 2nd story wall, this would trigger a disturbance in the signal. A wireless bridge is a terrific option for long range circumstances where trees and poles are not present.</p>
<p>Justin was considerate and incredibly expert, providing us outstanding customer care. We upgraded to wireless security and he was very patient as he explained how to add the app to our phones, and provided me a very well done individual training session on the information of the Safe Touch web page.

<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your house so we might point them at the same area and expose them all to the very same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting components, which I had actually set up on the deck by a certified electrical expert (who happens to be my husband).
