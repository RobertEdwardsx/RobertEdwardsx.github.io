<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," enabling them to record clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a brightened room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see during the night. If catching video in the dark is a priority, ensure your camera has a lot of IR LEDs.</p>

We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to want to differentiate expected visitors from random strangers. We also found the feature to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to identify faces on a nearby TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also provide a larger series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
