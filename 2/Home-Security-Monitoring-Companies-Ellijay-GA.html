<p>The cover of darkness isn't sufficient to keep this late night lurker's identity hidden from Arlo's view.

Since the Pro 2 doesn't do continuous video recording, it takes a second for the camera to really switch on when it identifies motion.

<p>So why do not we rank ADT higher? In some methods, ADT annoys us. We see so many growing companies branching off and trying new things in the home security space. However ADT isn't keeping up. It costs a lot, its rates isn't constantly transparent, and it still has long agreements. Not to discuss that the customer service experience varies extensively depending on the dealer you choose. </p>
