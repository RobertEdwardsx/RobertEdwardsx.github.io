<p>After we used the Anker EufyCam for almost 6 months, we're shocked to report that it is on track to provide on its promise of up to one year of battery life.

<h3>Fire Alarm System in Magalia CA</h3>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not fantastic-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
