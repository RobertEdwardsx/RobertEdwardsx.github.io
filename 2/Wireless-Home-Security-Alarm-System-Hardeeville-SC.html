Nevertheless, after nearly two years of day, night and use images have actually always been clear, and we never ever had problems with the camera missing motion, a problem we experienced when evaluating the Wyze Camera Pan And for those times when you're left wondering why your camera sent a motion alert, Wyze has a creative feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It produces a green, on-screen box around the motion found.

Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also offer a broader series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
