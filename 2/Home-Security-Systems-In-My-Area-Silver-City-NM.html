<p>Hi there Claudine, can you access this dome security camera or not? You may access this camera via your mobile phone or PC and inspect out whether your camera is working if yes. If not, you might take a look at the dome camera at night and see if there is any red glow released by the infrared lights ringed around the lens. If yes, then the dome camera is working. Hope this assists.</p>
<p>The rate of admission for the Deep Sentinel Home Security system isn't that steep, even at $499, since it includes 3 outdoor cameras with two-way audio. And the $50-per-month subscription cost sounds costly, however it's not a lot when you think about that a live human is seeing a live feed whenever the cameras find suspicious activity. That person at Deep Sentinel's center can warn a suspicious individual that they're being observed, and they can call your local police dispatcher if they refuse to leave or engage in a criminal act. It's not for everybody, but it's the best Do It Yourself outdoor security camera we've seen to date.</p>
