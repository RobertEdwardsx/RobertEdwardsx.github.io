Our tester felt that the pro who installed his Vivint system was courteous, timely, and honest (even reducing his costs after understanding they didn't need to install one camera). EPS Security does not disclose installation, in advance, or regular monthly monitoring fees. They service Michigan and surrounding areas.</p>

They are also extremely integratable, because wireless systems can be synched up with other home automation functions, such as smart locks and lights.</p>
