In a lot of cases, you'll be able to install cameras and electrical wiring simply by running the wires through a drop tile ceiling and into the wall.

Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies only an incorrect complacency since it avoids just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
