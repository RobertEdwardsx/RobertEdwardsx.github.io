If you prepare to combine the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first read the What about Ring? section from our smart video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it comes to video items, we don't believe that these concerns modify the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay confident in our existing suggestion.</p>
