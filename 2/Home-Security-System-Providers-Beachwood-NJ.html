<p>We have actually long been fans of the Netatmo Invite camera (₤ 199), with its understated looks and face recognition software application. The latter allows you to see specifically when a particular person gets to the house - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner showed up on time. However Netatmo has expanded its security variety with a brilliant outdoor camera and security light, the Presence (₤ 249.99), and a three pack of weatherproof doors and window sensing units called Tags (₤ 89.99). They also prepare to launch a clever smoke alarm and siren later on this year, that makes this an even better proposition.</p>

However, with an unmonitored system, it depends on you to contact the cops or other emergency situation services if your home is in risk. Still, the unmonitored system is much less expensive and therefore is still the much better alternative for lots of who are just concerned about cost. </p>
