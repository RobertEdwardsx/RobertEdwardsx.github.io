<p>The Hive View provides terrific 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation set off too easily, even when on the lowest level of sensitivity setting.

Furthermore, if the main patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, showing that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would examine the danger and, if required, could merely push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular floor.</p>

When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might need less wiring in the walls however will still require cable televisions to power the security camera individually, generally through 110VAC power. </p>
