<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we could point them at the same spot and expose them all to the same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting components, which I had installed on the deck by a certified electrician (who occurs to be my partner).

We likewise discovered the feature to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a nearby TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also provide a wider range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
