<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you desire one? Here is a brief explanation of how thermal cameras work: All things give off infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature level. The infrared energy discharged by an item is called its heat signature. In basic, the hotter an item is, the more radiation it discharges. A thermal camera includes a heat sensor that can detecting small distinctions in temperature. The device gathers the infrared radiation from things in the scene and creates an electronic image based upon information about the temperature level differences. Since objects are seldom precisely the same temperature level as other things around them, a thermal camera can spot them, and they will look like unique in a thermal image.</p>

<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it offers protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software to identify it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only an incorrect sense of security considering that it avoids only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
