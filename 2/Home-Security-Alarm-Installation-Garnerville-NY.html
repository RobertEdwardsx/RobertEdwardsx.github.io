<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it offers protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software to detect it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only a false complacency given that it avoids just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
