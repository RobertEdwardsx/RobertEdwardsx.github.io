One benefit of a wired security camera is that it will consistently get power, and you will not have to be interested in charging a battery or having sunlight for solar energy.</p>
<p>Xiaomi's Mi Home Security Camera isn't quite as cheap as our previous pick in this category-- the $20 Wyze Webcam V2-- however Xiaomi's Mi Home Security Camera is an even much better value at $40. ADT's track record and monitoring services stand apart from the remainder of the pack.
