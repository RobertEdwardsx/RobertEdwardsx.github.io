Over my 25 plus year profession in the security market, I have investigated, sold, installed, and due to the fact that we have our own central station at American Alarm Systems, viewed alarm signals for more hours than I wish to confess.</p>
<p>Your security system will be monitored by our operators at our own UL Listed main monitoring station. All of the cameras in a provided system need a central video recorder in order to send and archive the video they are catching.

<p>As a young upstart in the home security market, Armorax can not offer the quality control based on name recognition like ADT, but it does have a compelling business model, with versatile strategies, top-line 2GIG equipment, and a Do It Yourself installation choice.

<p>IP security cameras record analog images and convert them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing abilities like compression and motion detection. The recorded digital video stream is then broadcast over a local location network (LAN) utilizing Ethernet (CAT5 or CAT6) cable to a Network Video Recorder (NVR), which captures each camera's signal, compresses, and records it to a storage drive for retrieval and evaluation. The system can be set up to interact by means of network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
<p>As an inducement to buy an alarm system, a number of companies use "totally free monitoring services" for the first few months. Many insurance provider offer discount rates on insurance premiums to consumers with operable alarm systems. These discounts may be as much as 20 percent for commercial clients, and a little less for residential owners. 16 In addition, numerous police departments use several "totally free" false alarms before imposing any fine, although the cost to react is considerable right from the start. The deals of free monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurance providers call into question the suitability of the current trend in U.S. policing of enabling 3 or 4 complimentary incorrect alarms per calendar year, because they supply no up-front incentives to motivate owners to prevent false alarms.</p>
