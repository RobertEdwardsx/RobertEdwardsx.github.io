<p>ASIN: B01DJ1FTTS Foscam R2 2MP 1080P HD Wireless Security Camera (Black)I bought the Foscam R2 2MP 1080P HD Wireless Security Camara - black about one week earlier, my asian purpose was to keep my baby's crying noticed easily with this camera, and it works excellent till now.

<h3>Home Automation Security System in Bedford IN</h3>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not excellent-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
