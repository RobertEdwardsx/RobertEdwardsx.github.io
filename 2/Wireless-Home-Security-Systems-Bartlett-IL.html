When a patient pushes the emergency button, it sends out dual notifies: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Moreover, if the main patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, suggesting that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would assess the danger and, if required, might merely push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific flooring.</p>
