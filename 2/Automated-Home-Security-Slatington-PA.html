<h3>Top Home Security Companies in Pennsylvania</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've found that battery life never ever matches the producer's stats since this comes from tests in a regulated environment without constant video recording, which is the most significant perpetrator for short battery life without a doubt.
