<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely normal given that the doorway and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of recording video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when customers recognize that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's normally far too late since the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
