<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it supplies protection only when the wireless device is "off the air".

Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies only an incorrect complacency since it avoids only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
