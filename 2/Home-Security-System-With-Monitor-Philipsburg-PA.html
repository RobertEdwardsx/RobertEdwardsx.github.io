You simply plug it in and you're up and running.

<p>The Nest Cam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were outstanding in our testing-- during the day and during the night-- with a broad, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that permitted us to get a closer view in live video. We need to keep in mind that the camera would occasionally downgrade the image quality based upon available bandwidth, which could change throughout the day. Nest includes the alternative to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, however that may beat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>
