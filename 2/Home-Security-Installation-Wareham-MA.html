<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that distinguish between people and basic motion. We think that's costly.</p>

<p>Your place and possible dangers will identify whether hidden or noticeable cameras are right for you. If you're worried about your cameras being disabled, you might wish to conceal them.

For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
