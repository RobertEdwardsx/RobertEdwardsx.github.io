<p>The Blink XT2 is small, runs on 2 AA batteries, and includes a year's worth of complimentary cloud storage, and it captures a better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a pick? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, smartphone notices and live views were painfully sluggish, and the range is bad. Also, if the camera is in the middle of recording, don't expect to get a live peek or make any settings modifications-- it can't multitask.</p>
