<p>Home security companies that use professional monitoring will normally need an agreement dedication of anywhere from 12 to 60 months.

That's still significant, however it's a lot less than the average loss of a break-in. While the rate of thefts nationally has actually decreased, the average loss has increased-- in 2018, that number was close to $3,0002 (more on that in the break-in stats section above).</p>
