<p>6 basic CCTV security camera innovations exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. In a network injection attack, a hacker can make use of gain access to points that are exposed to non-filtered network traffic, specifically relaying network traffic such as Covering Tree" (802.1 D), OSPF, RIP, and HSRP The hacker injects bogus networking re-configuration commands that affect routers, switches, and smart hubs.

<p>The biggest downside of SmartThings is that there's no camera. As such, if an alarm or sensor gets triggered while you're away, you have no visual ways of confirming if something is in fact wrong and how major the situation is.
