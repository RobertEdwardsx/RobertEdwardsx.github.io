<p>According to a report, homes that do not have a security system are 3 times most likely to be robbed. Brinks owns and operates its own US-based monitoring center.

<p>A self-monitored security system is typically created to be simple so you can install it yourself without problem.

<p>A wireless doorbell camera can work as a stand-alone device or in tandem with the rest of your security system. It triggers the doorbell camera when somebody sounds the doorbell.

<p>Face acknowledgment, however, is just one form of automated video analysis being released with surveillance cameras. IBM, for instance, uses an advanced analytical software application that it claims can determine abnormalities in public spaces (such as deserted packages) and track people based upon their clothes, glasses, or facial hair.

When purchasing a video recorder, you need to first ensure that the device will deal with the cameras you have actually bought. The cameras should be able to provide you with the essential information if you're working with a surveillance system integrator to configure your system.</p>
