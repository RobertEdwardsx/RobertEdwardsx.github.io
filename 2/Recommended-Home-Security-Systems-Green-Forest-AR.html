<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it offers protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software application to find it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just a false complacency considering that it prevents just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
