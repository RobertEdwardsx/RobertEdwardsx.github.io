<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range".

As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally typical since the entrance and room seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everyone going into the store.
