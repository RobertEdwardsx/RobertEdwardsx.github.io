<h2>Security & Surveillance Solutions Bloomfield</h2>
<p>I have this camera connected to my desktop computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cord, I was able location the camera around 10 feet far from my desk aiming into my hallway. The security program I use is "blue iris" which was able to find the camera without problem. The IR lights during the night are able to throw light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not nearly as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, however it was half the cost and it doesn't consume my wifi bandwidth.</p>
<p>After reading the talk about this page I went to Armorax's website to see what they used; they've partnered with another security company and their starter bundle I believe starts at $0 down.
