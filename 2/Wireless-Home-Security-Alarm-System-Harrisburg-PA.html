<p>The disadvantage to a wireless system is that it relies on a wireless signal, suggesting that storms and strong winds have the power to interfere with the system and could even trigger incorrect alarms. False alarms are known to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might result in fines from the provider or the police if they occur regularly enough. Another possible disadvantage to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment should be replaced or charged regularly in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more costly than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is generally offset by the reality that there are no installation expenses.</p>
<p>We attempted each of the cameras in multiple areas around our house, varying from 6 feet to 30 feet away from our Wi-Fi router, which was connected to Verizon Fios service. When possible, we evaluated each camera using an iOS device (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) as well as an Android mobile phone (using a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie). Although FrontPoint uses a wide variety of equipment and home automation products at a reasonable price, the one area where the company particularly stands out remains in DIY installation. </p>
