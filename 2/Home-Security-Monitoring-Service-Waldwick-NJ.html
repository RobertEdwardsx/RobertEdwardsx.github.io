<h3>Home Wireless Alarm Waldwick NJ 07463</h3>
<p>The Blink XT2 is small, runs on 2 AA batteries, and consists of a year's worth of free cloud storage, and it records a much better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a pick? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, mobile phone notifications and live views were painfully sluggish, and the range is bad.
