<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to check in on the kids; 2- and four-legged alike.

<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to catch clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in an illuminated room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see in the evening. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if capturing video in the dark is a top priority.</p>
