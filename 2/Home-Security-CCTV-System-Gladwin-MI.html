The technology slowly evolved into the extremely advanced yet cost effective systems available today. The first usages of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to record video and view it later. Although video surveillance was monitored out of need in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to enhance the result of security systems.</p>
