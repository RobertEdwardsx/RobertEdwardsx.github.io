The one time where lag does become a bit of a problem is between spotting and tape-recording movement. Since the Pro 2 does not do constant video recording, it takes a 2nd for the camera to in fact switch on when it spots motion. They might get past the camera before it had time to tape them if a wicked wrongdoer was fast enough.</p>

<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras are able to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," allowing them to record clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in an illuminated space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording footage in the dark is a priority.</p>
<p>Basically, wireless security systems count on cellular signals to work - while wired systems work utilizing radio frequency.

Once a signal is gotten, you'll get an alert from the security provider's mobile app, web, text, or email website. They'll likewise receive an alert to immediately help you with emergency situation responders as required if your wireless home security system is expertly monitored. </p>
