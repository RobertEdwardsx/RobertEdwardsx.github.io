<p>Your CCTV camera may make you feel physically safer, but after reading this short article, it will sure make you feel virtually vulnerable. A couple of minutes into the DIY installation, our tester got stuck getting her control board up and online-- it simply wouldn't link. An assistance window appeared with a number to call, and a Frontpoint rep helped her troubleshoot the connection. After about 10 minutes, he could tell there was a problem with the circuit board. Definitely not ideal-- but the representative asked forgiveness and delivered her replacement control board overnight.</p>
