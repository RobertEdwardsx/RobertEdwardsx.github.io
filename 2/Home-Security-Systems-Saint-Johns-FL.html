<p>Just recently, Ring denied reports that it had suffered a data breach, but we concur with its recommendation that users need to reset passwords and make it possible for two-factor authentication as a precautionary measure. All smart-home devices are susceptible to such events. Nevertheless, after this most current entry in a year-long series of controversial media reports, we have chosen to pull our recommendation of Ring's video doorbells. If you plan to combine the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first read the What about Ring? section from our clever video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it pertains to video products, we don't believe that these concerns alter the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay positive in our existing recommendation.</p>

Vivint has no minimum agreement requirement if you buy your equipment upfront.</p>
