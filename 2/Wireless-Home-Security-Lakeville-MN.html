<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your house so we could point them at the very same area and expose them all to the exact same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting components, which I had actually installed on the deck by a certified electrician (who happens to be my husband).

<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face signals, which can identify people the camera is finding utilizing face recognition. When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to identify those individuals and will send out smart device alerts with that information when they appear at your home. We believe this feature (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to want to distinguish expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the function to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to determine faces on a nearby TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also provide a wider series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
