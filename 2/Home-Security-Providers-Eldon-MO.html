We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also pestered with fuzzy night vision and left spaces (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips.

As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everybody going into the shop.
