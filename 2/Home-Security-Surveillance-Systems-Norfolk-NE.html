<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky.

<p>But monitored systems also tend to have a service contract, which locks you into paying an often-pricey month-to-month cost for a set amount of time, normally one to 5 years.

Paying for the equipment in advance supplies you with a lot of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you utilize the service. And you can stop the monitoring and begin service as lot of times as you want.</p>
