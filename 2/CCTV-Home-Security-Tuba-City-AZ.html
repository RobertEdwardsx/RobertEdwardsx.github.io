<p>When using IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do nowadays - you will more than likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the big quantity of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at really quick speeds, and typically over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reputable, however not compatible with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will likewise power the security cameras, getting rid of the requirement for more circuitry. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may need less electrical wiring in the walls however will still need cables to power the security camera separately, usually via 110VAC power. </p>
