<p>Boost safety and security with Medianet-enabled Cisco Video Surveillance IP Cameras. The Ring Stick Up Cam is available in wired and battery versions, which can be utilized inside and outdoors. However neither can tape-record constantly, and they both need the Ring Protect strategy to record recordings.

Both also lack individual detection and geofencing, which other cameras use to reduce false notifies.</p>
