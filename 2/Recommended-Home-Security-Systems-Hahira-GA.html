This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are trusted, but not compatible with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the requirement for further circuitry. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch.
