<p>We don't recommend the SmartThings SmartCam because it's more complex than it needs to be. Recordings, signals, and combination all need separate IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are stored for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month charge (or $80 each year) to save 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limitations, we typically found action missing, thanks to prolonged and irregular spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>

Search for a system with a companion app, a cool mobile app that allows you to gain access to, monitor, and manage your system from practically anywhere.

<p>The Frontpoint Security system, together with its Interactive plan, was our favorite home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and features are almost similar to those of the Brinks system. However, Frontpoint's plans are somewhat more costly for the very same level of service, its agreements are longer, its cancellation costs are difficult, and its prices is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer suggest anyway.</p>
