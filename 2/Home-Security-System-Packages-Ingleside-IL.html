In a network injection attack, a hacker can use access points that are exposed to non-filtered network traffic, specifically relaying network traffic such as Covering Tree" (802.1 D), OSPF, RIP, and HSRP The hacker injects bogus networking re-configuration commands that impact routers, switches, and intelligent hubs.
