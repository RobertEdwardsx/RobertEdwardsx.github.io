<p>As far as the app goes, D-Link has clearly attempted to give it an appealing edge, and we have to offer credit to its ability to show what's going on from as much as 4 cameras at a time. It can be slow and awkward to use on occasion - with the procedure of connecting to the camera for a live view rather sluggish at times. The previous, less expensive version of the outdoor Nest web cam is still on sale too if you wish to save some money - it does have a cable attached though, instead of working wirelessly, which suggests it's a bit much easier to undermine for potential intruders. Certainly one of the very best security cameras in 2020.</p>
<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is premium, if not particularly cutting-edge, so we're truly advising the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will likewise like Nest's contract-free plan alternative.
