<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't opt to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced features, such as alerts that distinguish between individuals and basic motion. We believe that's pricey.</p>
