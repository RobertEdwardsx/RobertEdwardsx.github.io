<h3>Best Wireless Home Security in Texas</h3>
<p>This system employs an electro-magnetic field disturbance principle based on 2 unshielded (or 'leaky') coaxial cables buried around 30 cm (1 feet) deep and 1 m (10 feet) apart. 6 The transmitter produces continuous Radio Frequency (RF) energy along one cable television and the energy is received by the other cable television.

<p>A tight wire border security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to identify any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Unwanted alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to neglect items that put in percentages of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to avoid this kind of attack.</p>
