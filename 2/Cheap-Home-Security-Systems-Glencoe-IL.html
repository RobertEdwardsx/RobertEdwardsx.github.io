<p>A tight wire boundary security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to discover any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms caused by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensors to overlook objects that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is susceptible to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is set up to prevent this type of attack.</p>

Regrettably, history has revealed that surveillance innovations put in place for one purpose undoubtedly broaden into other usages. And with video technology most likely to continue advancing, the absence of any clear limits for what CCTV systems need to have the ability to do presents a substantial threat.</p>
