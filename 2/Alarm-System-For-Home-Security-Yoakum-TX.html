<p>I described that all we would need to do is tap into any among the emergency call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also included two-way audio, and that camera would end up being the interface into the VMS system. When a patient pushes the emergency situation button, it sends dual signals: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS.

<p>There is a new pattern in surveillance video search technology that is quickly changing the security market, and it is called Deep Learning". What is Deep Learning and why is it so essential?  For starters, Deep Learning permits somebody to discover what they are trying to find without needing to search through hours of worthless video footage.  Envision a website that works a lot like a Google search, where you can explain the components you are searching for in the tape-recorded video footage.
