On the other hand, we recommend contract-free systems if you do not wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term arrangement (and who does?). Our choice: No contract.</p>

<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we might point them at the very same spot and expose them all to the exact same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had actually set up on the deck by a licensed electrical contractor (who happens to be my husband). All of the cameras were connected to the very same 2.4 GHz network via a Wi-Fi router inside (around 40 feet from the cameras); service to your house was Verizon Fios.</p>
<p>When I eventually entered into the camera controls, I was reasonably impressed. The camera quality isn't half bad, there's a strong night-vision mode, and all the app controls are fairly obvious. You have actually got two-way audio, you can play tunes simply to let the individual being seen understand they're being viewed, and you can choose to record video clips or images and save them to your smart gadget on a whim. </p>
