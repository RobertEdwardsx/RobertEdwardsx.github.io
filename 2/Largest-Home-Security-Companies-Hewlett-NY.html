<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can move the big amount of information required by digital video and high resolutions at very fast speeds, and typically over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are trusted, but not suitable with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, eliminating the need for additional wiring.

Wireless security cameras might need less circuitry in the walls but will still require cables to power the security camera individually, typically by means of 110VAC power. </p>
