This design from Samsung Wisenet will fit the expense if you're looking for a robust DVR system that feels premium and records in 2K quality. It ships with four white and streamlined bullet-style cameras designed for indoor and outdoor use. They're equipped with night vision tech that utilizes infrared LEDs and clever IR to provide up to130ft (or 40m) night vision range. Like others on our list, the DVR system deals with a mobile app that lets you view what the cameras are seeing in real-time, though we found in our testing that the app occasionally forgot cameras which then needed to be re-added.</p>

Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there.
