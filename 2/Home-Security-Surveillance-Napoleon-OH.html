<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face informs, which can identify people the camera is identifying utilizing face recognition. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to determine those people and will send out smart device notifies with that details when they show up at your home. We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to identify anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the function to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to identify faces on a close-by TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also supply a larger series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
