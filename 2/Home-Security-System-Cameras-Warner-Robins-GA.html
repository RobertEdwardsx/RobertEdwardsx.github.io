<p>We deliver value-added security and surveillance systems and services using benefit, peace of mind and satisfaction to every consumer and are dedicated to fulfilling our customer's needs with stability, sincerity, enthusiasm and excellent service. Dependability has actually long been at the heart of the argument over wireless versus hardwired home security systems. It's a dispute that's often manipulated by elements such as apprehension over the susceptibility of wireless systems, including disturbance from radio signals and glitches that cause false alarms. While enhancements recently have made the technology more popular and robust (some systems today have their own distinct wireless technology, which can't be disrupted by other signals), concerns continue over vulnerabilities that do not affect hardwired systems.</p>

<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we could point them at the exact same area and expose them all to the same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting components, which I had set up on the patio by a licensed electrical expert (who occurs to be my other half). All of the cameras were connected to the same 2.4 GHz network through a Wi-Fi router inside (around 40 feet from the cameras); service to the house was Verizon Fios.</p>
<p>Security cameras that become part of a monitored security system typically have the exact same functions and choices as stand-alone cameras. Keep cameras off your home wifi network.
