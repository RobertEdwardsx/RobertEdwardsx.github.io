<p>On the surface area, these two camera classifications might appear comparable, though if you were able to see within, the distinctions become unique and apparent.

Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software to identify it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within variety.
