<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as notices that compare individuals and general motion. We believe that's pricey.</p>
