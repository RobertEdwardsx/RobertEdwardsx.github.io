<p>Nothing is more vital than securing what you treasure most ... your family and home. The implicit reason for the current push to increase video surveillance is the threat of terrorist attacks. But suicide opponents are clearly not prevented by camera - and may even be attracted to the television coverage cameras can ensure - and the cost of a substantial video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up around 20 percent of that country's criminal justice budget - far goes beyond the minimal advantages that the system may provide in investigating attacks or attempted attacks after the reality (see reality sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
<p>A system that needs a contract might be a wise choice for those who are cash-strapped or do not want to spend for the equipment up-front. Why?
