<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents consulting with someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is activated. Let's face it, false alarms are relatively common. If a property owner forgets their keys and goes back within with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensor is activated by a community cat, it can trigger the alarm. With an expertly monitored system, the house owner will be gotten in touch with by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it rapidly.

Increasing deployment of voice over IP technology (VoIP) is driving the adoption of broadband signaling for alarm reporting. Lots of sites requiring alarm setups no longer have traditional telephone lines (POTS), and alarm panels with standard telephone dialer capability do not work reliably over some kinds of VoIP service.</p>
