<p>We didn't think about alarm systems that required expert installation. Pro-installed systems typically cost more, usage equipment comparable to that of Do It Yourself systems, come with long and generally burdensome contracts, and frequently depend on the exact same monitoring companies that self-installed systems use, so they offer little advantage.

The SereneLife Indoor IP Camera offers exceptional image quality that isn't jeopardized once the lights go out.</p>
<p>The Hive View delivers great 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation activated too easily, even when on the most affordable level of sensitivity setting. Since this camera has no native geofencing functions, you need to manually stop alerts (and recording, since it does that even when notifications are off). We also experienced above-average connectivity issues, with 2 Hive test units detaching eight times over 2 months.</p>

<p>But monitored systems also tend to have a service contract, which locks you into paying an often-pricey monthly cost for a set amount of time, usually one to five years. No-contract systems, which enable you to pay for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis rather than devoting to a long-term plan, are ending up being more typical. These systems sometimes cost more up front for the hardware than professional systems that offer a discount rate in exchange for that prolonged service arrangement. Paying for the equipment up front provides you with a great deal of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you use the service. And you can start and stop the monitoring service as sometimes as you want.</p>
