<p>The Blue by ADT Outdoor Camera is a work in progress. We've seen improvements during our short time with the battery-operated camera, but we simply can't recommend a $200 camera that doesn't offer the capability to zoom video and will not be able to stand up to outdoor temperatures below 14 degrees Fahrenheit.

For somebody looking for a more complex setup like home automation, or somebody that desires a trained professional to make the recommendation for the setup, specialist installation is a great choice.

There are companies out there like Frontpoint that are known to be especially useful in this stage.</p>
