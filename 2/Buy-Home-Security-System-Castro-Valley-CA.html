<p>We attempted each of the cameras in numerous areas around our house, varying from 6 feet to 30 feet away from our Wi-Fi router, which was linked to Verizon Fios service. When possible, we checked each camera utilizing an iOS gadget (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) along with an Android mobile phone (utilizing a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie).
