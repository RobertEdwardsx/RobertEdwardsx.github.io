<p>Somewhat more expensive than our winning wise alarm, this system was practically as simple to install and, during testing, the loud, clear siren fasted to sound if one of the sensors had actually been activated. We like that the system consists of a wifi security camera and just informs you when motion is produced by something with the same heat pattern as a human (making sure there's no false informs). However, you do need to sign up for the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 monthly) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get informs on your phone if the sensing units have been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are readily available that have crucial fobs and additional sensors, too.</p>
