<p>While you have to spend for cloud video storage on the Arlo Pro 3, it's one of the more cost effective subscriptions out there at $2.99 a month. This is a costly security camera, however we believe it's worth the investment. Increasing deployment of voice over IP technology (VoIP) is driving the adoption of broadband signaling for alarm reporting. Numerous sites requiring alarm installations no longer have traditional telephone lines (POTS), and alarm panels with conventional telephone dialer capability do not work dependably over some types of VoIP service.</p>

The camera quality isn't half bad, there's a strong night-vision mode, and all the app controls are fairly self-explanatory. You've got two-way audio, you can play melodies simply to let the individual being viewed understand they're being viewed, and you can pick to tape video clips or images and save them to your clever device on an impulse. </p>
